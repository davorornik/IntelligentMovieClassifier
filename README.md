## Dataset

The dataset is from https://github.com/sahildit/IMDB-Movies-Extensive-Dataset-Analysis

## Building

To create the project you have to build it first with

```bash
npm run build
```

then when the build is finished run the server.js with the Node.js

```bash
node .\server.js
```

don't use npm run preview or npm run dev, because it dosen't start the backend.
